BASIC IDEA:
    There are two parts for this project:
    1. Website
    2. A desktop app
Let us have 2 roles for now:
    1. Ghost User - who controls others computers via the website
    2. Ghosted User - who is controlled by the Ghost User via the website(He has to install the desktop app on his computer)

Ghost User who wants to control other computers remotely can first signup into the website with his credentials.
Ghosted User who wants to be controlled by the Ghost User can first intall the desktop app from the website's home page.

For a Ghosted user to be controlled by the Ghost User, he has to give his computer's unique id to the Ghost User.
And ghosted user can even allow different permissions that the ghost user can get depending on which ghost user will be able to perform only limited operation on ghosted user.
The Ghost User can then control the Ghosted User's computer via the website.

Ghost User logs into the website and initially there are 2 sections visible to him:
    where he can see list of ghosted users  who gave ascess to him to control their computer
    1. Devices for which control ascess isn't expired yet.
    2. Devices for which he has ascess in the past but it has expired.
    The Control Section and MyGhosts section are similar to whatsapp's chats section on the left of whatsappweb with search functionality.

🎨 Bonus: UI/UX Tips
Stick to a dark theme with neon/glow effects (matches the "ghost" hacker vibe)

Use animated SVGs or Lottie for interaction visuals

If possible, show a live demo panel (mocked interaction with a fake device)

✅ Tech Stack Suggestion
If you're using Next.js + Tailwind (as you mentioned before), you can:

Use @clerk/nextjs for auth

Use Socket.IO to show real-time device connection status

Add loading skeletons for devices

👉 Want me to generate the actual landing page HTML/React/Next.js code for this layout?
Just say:

"Yes, generate Ghost Socket homepage in Next.js"
or
"Make me the layout in Tailwind + HTML"
or
"Show me the devices panel React component"
